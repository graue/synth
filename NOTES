Internally these programs use floats.

unfmt converts a raw waveform using integer samples to
float, and fmt does the reverse. They assume the endianness
of the integer samples matches that of the CPU.

As an example of how to use these programs, you can make a
song 6 dB louder (2x the amplitude) as follows. softsat, a
really good saturator/limiter worthy of mastering use, is in
there to prevent clipping:

unfmt -16 <mysong.raw | amp -vol 2.0 | softsat | fmt -16 >louder.raw

This code is copyright-free.


You can build each program with the provided "build" script.
Type "./build *.c" to make them all. To put the binaries in
a separate directory, you can do something like "mkdir bin"
and "cd bin" and "../build ../*.c".

For a big-endian system, add -DWORDS_BIGENDIAN=1 to the gcc
invocation line in the build script. This is required for
unfmt and fmt to work right with 24-bit audio. (I don't have
a big-endian system to test on, so if it still doesn't work,
email me: graue@oceanbase.org).


To find out what options a program takes, run it with the
"-help" option.
