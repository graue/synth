Internally these programs use floats.

unfmt converts a raw waveform using integer samples to
float, and fmt does the reverse. They assume the endianness
of the integer samples matches that of the CPU.

softsat is a really good limiter that combined with amp can
be used for mastering purposes. Most other things are just
toys. Example usage:

unfmt -16 <mysong.raw | amp -vol 2.0 | softsat | fmt -16 >louder.raw
