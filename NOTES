Internally these programs use floats.

unfmt converts a raw waveform using integer samples to float, and fmt does the
reverse. They may only work on little-endian machines for the time being.

softsat is a really good limiter that combined with amp can be used for
mastering purposes. Everything else is just a toy. Example usage:

unfmt -16 <mysong.raw | amp -vol 2.0 | softsat | fmt -16 >mastered.raw
