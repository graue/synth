# Synth utilities

These are command line programs for manipulating audio. They expect
input on stdin and produce output on stdout. They all deal with raw
32-bit float audio. Floating-point samples are nice because they can go
above 1.0 and not clip.

Eventually, the goal is/was to replace all of this with the more modular
[Truesynth project](https://github.com/graue/synth), but I continue to
use these programs, so why not release them to the world.



## Example: make something louder

    unfmt -16 <mysong.raw | amp -dB +6 | softsat | fmt -16 >louder.raw

This assumes mysong.raw is a raw waveform with 16-bit integer samples,
like a typical .wav with the header stripped off.

`unfmt -16` takes 16-bit integer samples and converts them to 32-bit
float. It's worth knowing that while 16-bit integer samples (by
definition) range from -32768 to 32767, these utilities all treat -1.0
to 1.0 as full-scale. So `unfmt -16` is not only converting, but also
dividing by 32768.0.

`amp -dB +6` increases the level by six decibels, which is about double
the amplitude (you could also use `amp -vol 2.0`, but usually dBs are
more friendly). Fun fact: While you can double an amplitude, there's not
really such a thing as "twice as loud" â€” the ear doesn't work that way.

`softsat` is a soft clipper. This effect lowers all samples into the
acceptable -1.0 to 1.0 range while adding less distortion than you would
get from hard clipping.

`fmt -16` does the opposite of the `unfmt` command.



## Installing

You can build each program with the provided `build` script.  Type
`./build *.c` to make them all. To put the binaries in a separate
directory, you can do something like `mkdir bin` and `cd bin` and
`../build ../*.c`.

### Endianness note

I have never tested this software on a big-endian system. `fmt` and
`unfmt` are the only programs that will care (since all the others use
floats), and you may have to change them to do what you want.



## Usage

To find out what options a program takes, run it with the `-help`
option. All programs assume 44100 KHz sample rate by default, which you
can override by setting the `RATE` or `SR` environment variable; for
example, type `export RATE=48000` in the shell before running these
programs.

### Generators [input nothing, output floats]:

* envelope: (with -generate option or if stdin is a tty)
* octagon: octagon wave (between square & tri) oscillator
* rossler: rossler oscillator
* saw: up/down saw wave oscillator
* sine: sine wave oscillator
* square: square wave oscillator
* tri: triangle wave oscillator
* white: white noise

### Time-stretching effects [input and output floats]:

* stretch: time and pitch stretcher, or resampler

I give this its own category because it is the only effect where number
of samples in and out won't be equal.

### Effects [input and output floats]:

* amp: gainer
* clip: hard clipper
* comp: peak/RMS compressor
* delay: delay line
* delay2: delay line with LFO
* deriv: differentiates input
* envelope: applies an envelope to input (can also be a generator with
  the -generate option)
* filter: IIR biquad filter (highpass, lowpass, bandpass & more)
* foldback: foldback distortion
* gate: a simple "gate"
* int: integrates input
* limit: crappy limiter, use limit2 instead
* limit2: a fairly decent lookahead limiter
* midside: left/right -> mid/side stereo converter
* pan: panner
* pink: FIR filter designed to convert white to pink noise
* power: raises all samples to a power (i.e., a distortion effect)
* reverb: a brute-force, unsophisticated but useful reverb
* sampbins: randomized sample-and-hold effect
* sfclip2: soft-clipper (avoid, softsat is better)
* shape: waveshaper distortion
* sine: with -modfreq option, input modulates sine frequency
* sineclip: weird noise effect, clips to shape of sine wave
* sinshape: strange sine-based waveshaper
* softclip: soft clipper (avoid, softsat is better)
* softsat: soft saturator / limiter
* stwidth: stereo width adjuster

### Mixers [input floats from files, output floats]:

* mix: sum waves
* mul: multiply waves

### Utilities [other kinds of input and output]:

* fix: set float samples that are NaN (not-a-number) or infinity to zero
* fmt: convert floats to integer samples
* unfmt: convert integer samples to floats
